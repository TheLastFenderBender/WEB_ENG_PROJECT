# WEB_ENG_PROJECT
This is my Web_Eng course final Project that i am implementing along with three other group members.

Instructions to the collaborators:

there are two folders, Frontend and Backend

Backend:
this will contain the routes.js file, in this file i have seperated all of the sections based on our predetermined work division using comments.
do not alter each others sections without first notifying. keep your work in your own section.

Frontend:
to be decided, i will edit this readme as the project moves forward, for now focus on backend implementation.
